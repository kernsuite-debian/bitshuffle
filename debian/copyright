 Header File
 .
 Similar in concept to a queue. Each task includes reading an input
 and writing output, but the location of the input/output (the pointers)
 depend on the previous item in the chain.
 .
 This is designed for parallelizing blocked compression/decompression IO,
 where the destination of a compressed block depends on the compressed size
 of all previous blocks.
 .
 Implemented with OpenMP locks.
 .

 .
 Implements an LZF filter module for HDF5, using the BSD-licensed library
 by Marc Alexander Lehmann (http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/liblzf.html).
 .
 No Python-specific code is used.  The filter behaves like the DEFLATE
 filter, in that it is called for every type and space, and returns 0
 if the data cannot be compressed.

 HEAPMODE :
 Select how default compression functions will allocate memory for their hash table,
 in memory stack (0:default, fastest), or in memory heap (1:requires malloc()).
